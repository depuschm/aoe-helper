# aoe_helper
This program is intended to help the player while playing the game "Age of Empires II: DE".

## About

This program takes partial screenshots of the Ingame UI. After that, letters and number of the screenshot are recognized by a machine learning approach. The recognized characters are used to show the player more information while he is playing the game.

### Technologies used
These technologies are used to develop this program:
- Java
- [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) (used to make a click-through window)
- [jnativehook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook) (used for global keyboard listening)
- [tess4j](https://github.com/nguyenq/tess4j) (used to recognize characters)
